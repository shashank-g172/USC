This repository contains all the code developed as a Master's Student at the University of Southern California. Although most of the code was done as part of my coursework, there are a couple of my pet projects included in here. This repository contains code in the following languages:

Java
PHP 
MySQL
MySQLi
Android
HTML
CSS (with and without the Bootstrap API)
JavaScript (with jQuery)
C
C++
XML
XQuery
Xpath
XSLT

Apart from that, there are a couple of research papers about Android Security, as well as case studies analysis. Most of these projects were developed using the agile process framework.
