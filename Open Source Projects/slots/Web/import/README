This directory contains functions for importing iCal events

!!! This is very EXPERIMENTAL, You are WARNED !!!


=== CONFIGURATION ===

You can enable the iCal import by configuring 
  $conf['settings']['ics']['import'] = 'true'; 

Authentication is not enforced, but need to be ensured somewhere else: 
Assuming there is some other central authority for authenticating this, 
a secret import key can be defined to protect the interface. 
  $conf['settings']['ics']['import.key'] = ;


=== USAGE from the shell ===

    A resource is either identified by resource.public_id (parameter 'rid')
    or resource.contact_info (parameter 'contact_info').

    Note, there is currently no Web interface to define the contact_info, we have done it through the 
    mysql database like 	
	echo "UPDATE resources SET contact_info='test@room' WHERE name='Conference Room 1';" | mysql -p ....


Recommendations: define environment variables:

URL=https://domain.d.d/scheduleIt/Web;	# should match $conf['settings']['script.url']
IKEY=abcdef12345;			# match $conf['settings']['ics']['import.key']
RN=50aabbcc112233;      		# reservation number
USER=`whoami'


The http response contains a JSON data structure, containing the return arguments (e.g. the reservation_number after a create), 
The reservation number is needed for updating and deletion of this event.
