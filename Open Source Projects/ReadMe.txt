PHP Booked Project 

 This is a scheduling reservation system for doctors and their assistants to book surgery rooms across surgery centers around Los Angeles for outpatient surgeries.

 It offers various features, like map navigation based on current location, closest centers to a zip code and the number of surgery rooms available for the duration of the surgery. 

It can also be used to search by duration, type of resources required for easier filtering to book the right rooms. 

It runs on PHP, so a XAMPP or a WAMP server is necessary to run the code. I would suggest quickly going through the guide in the readme file for installation, and setting up the access to the MySQL database. I would imagine that the MySQL Server is already pre-configured on the machine. 

THey need to placed within the

1 .htdocs folder if you are using XAMPP
2. www folder if you are using WAMP

The files that need modification are config.php, and depending on your system, php.ini and your tools to work on it would be Eclipse with the PDT plugin installed.
